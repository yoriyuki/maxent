Compiling and installing maxent package
=======================================

NOTICE: This file only covers building the package under unix environment.
Readers from Win32 platform should consult the PDF manual in doc/manual.pdf
for instructions on building with various Win32 compilers.

Now go on:

The following build dependancies are required:
 * Jam (included) (http://www.perforce.com/)
 * Boost C++ library (subset of v1.48 included) (http://www.boost.org)
 * zlib library and headers (optional)
 * a fortran compiler (optional but highly recommended)

The boost lib shipped with this package is a subset of the full boost lib. If
you encounter building errors then please download the latest boost lib and 
try again.

You need to have a working Fortran compiler in order to take advantage of
LBFGS code. On OS X you can get gfortran installed using Homebrew:

$ brew install gfortran

All building commands must be executed from the top-level source directory. To 
configure the toolkit, just type:

$ ./configure

(NOTE: the leading '$' character is used to represent a shell prompt.  DO NOT
actually type that in!) This will run the `configure' script which will try to
figure out the configuration of your compilers automatically.

NB: If you see errors regarding the file format, make sure that 'configure'
and the shell scripts in the 'script' and 'tools' directories are in unix
format (e.g. by using an editor like UltraEdit).

Now you can build the package by calling:

$ make

Which will build the optimized library and command line tool "maxent".

    Optionally, you can build some unittest:
    $ make unittest

    If no error occurs, go to test/ directory and run all the test:
    $ cd test
    $ python runall.py

    All tests should pass without error except test_event, which may abort. (If
    you find an error, please write to me.)

To install the executable file and the lib you can type (as root):

# make install

To clean the build, type:

$ make clean

More details are covered in the PDF manual.

Please consult python/README for instruction on building the python extension
module.

====
For Mac OS X El Capitan
 xcode-select --install
 CXX=g++-5 ./configure
looks working
Only Pytnon2 works.
You need(?)
CC=gcc-5 python setup.py ...
